            I started my journey as a software developer by attending a coding bootcamp at Turing School of Software & Design, where I learned new skills remotely. Despite the challenges of the fast-paced learning environment, I found the experience extremely rewarding, with a strong emphasis on community-based learning. During Turing, I learned Javascript and some other techonologies like React.js, GSAP, and Material UI for the first time. After graduating, you faced the challenge of finding a job in the tech field so I've been keeping busy developing my own personal applications and websites. Despite this hurdle, I remain ambitious and committed to continuing my learning and pushing forward in my career as a software developer.
