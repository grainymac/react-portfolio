        Hey, whats up?! I'm a front-end developer with a passion for creating beautiful and functional user interfaces using React.js and SCSS. Also as a creative with diverse skills and interests, I have the ability to explore and express my ideas through a variety of mediums, each informing and enhancing the others. With my background in graphic design, I bring a unique perspective to my work and enjoy exploring new ways to integrate design into my coding projects. I'm a highly creative person who is always looking for ways to think outside the box and push my boundaries. My dream is to work on a team that develops solutions and applications that have a positive impact on people's lives. I recently graduated from a coding bootcamp called Turing School of Software & Design and am excited to continue learning and growing in my career as a developer.
